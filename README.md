# LDO-low-drop-out-reegulator-

LDOs help maintain a stable output voltage even when the input voltage fluctuates or is higher than the desired output.

Types of Linear Regulators

1. Standard Linear Regulators: These are basic voltage regulators that maintain a constant output voltage.
2. Low Dropout Linear Regulators (LDOs): These are specialized regulators designed to work with a smaller difference between the input and output voltages.

Key Difference: Dropout Voltage

* Dropout Voltage: This is the minimum voltage required across the regulator to keep the output voltage stable.

For example, if you have a 3.3V regulator with a 1V dropout voltage, the input voltage must be at least 4.3V to ensure the output stays regulated at 3.3V.
